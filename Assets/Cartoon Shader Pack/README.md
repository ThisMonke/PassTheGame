# Readme

Thank you for purchasing our package. We appreciate your trust in our product and are glad you have chosen it among the many options available. The demo scene is located in the Scenes folder and the source material can be found in the Sources folder. We hope you find our package useful and it will help you achieve your goals. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to us. We are here to help and support you in any way we can. 

This package contains a toon shader inspired by Legend of Zelda. To calculate lighting in shader, we used a common shading model called Blinn-Phong. Toon shading (often called cel shading) is a rendering style designed to make 3D surfaces emulate 2D, flat surfaces. The shader will receive light from a single directional source, and have specular reflections and rim lighting.

## Instructions:

1. Import the package containing the toon shader inspired by Legend of Zelda into your Unity3D project.
2. Apply the shader to the desired objects in your scene.
3. The shader uses the Blinn-Phong shading model to calculate lighting, giving the objects a toon or cel-shaded look.
4. The shader is designed to receive light from a single directional source, and has built-in support for specular reflections and rim lighting.
5. Adjust the shader's properties as desired to achieve the desired look for your scene.
6. If you want to use the shader with other light sources, you may need to adjust the way the lighting is calculated in the shader's code.


## Shader: "Cartoon Shadow Receiver"
This is a Unity shader that is used to create a cartoon-style shadow effect on objects in a 3D scene. The shader is applied to objects that will receive shadows, rather than objects that cast shadows. The Properties section of the shader defines a variable called _Alpha, which can be adjusted to control the transparency of the shadow effect.

In the SubShader section, there is a single Pass that sets the blending mode to SrcAlpha OneMinusSrcAlpha, which allows transparent pixels to blend with the background. The Pass also includes CGPROGRAM code that defines the vertex and fragment shaders.

The vertex shader, named "vert," takes in an input struct called "appdata" which contains a single float4 variable called "vertex." It output struct called "v2f" that contains a float4 variable "pos" which is the transformed position of the vertex and shadow coordinates.

The fragment shader, named "frag," takes in the "v2f" struct as input and returns a float4 variable called "SV_Target." The fragment shader calculates the shadow attenuation and defines the final color of the object with the shadow. The final color is a black color with an alpha value equal to (1 - shadow) * _Alpha. The "UsePass" line at the end of the shader tells Unity to use the "Legacy Shaders/VertexLit/SHADOWCASTER" pass on objects that cast shadows in the scene.


## Shader: "Cartoon Toon Shader"
This is a Unity Shader that uses the Blinn-Phong lighting model to create a "toon" look. It uses properties such as color, main texture, ambient color, specular color, glossiness, rim color, rim amount and rim threshold to control the appearance of the final image. The shader uses forward rendering and only receives data from the main directional light and ambient light. In the vertex function, it transforms the vertex position, normal and texture coordinate from object space to clip space, and in the fragment function it calculates the lighting using the Blinn-Phong model with values thresholded to create the "toon" look. It also includes a rim lighting effect and shadow mapping to add more realism to the image.

## Shader: "Cartoon Water"
This is a Unity Shader that creates a water effect, it uses several properties and textures to achieve this effect. The Properties define the color of the water when the surface below is shallow and deep, the maximum distance the surface below the water will affect the color gradient, the color of foam generated by objects intersecting the surface, a noise texture used to generate waves, the speed the noise will scroll, the cutoff value for the noise texture, a surface distortion texture and amount. The SubShader uses a transparent pass with normal blending and applies this effect on the geometry. The vertex and fragment shader functions are defined to calculate the UV coordinates, screen position, normal, etc. and sample the noise and distortion textures. The water surface is generated by blending the noise texture with the color gradient, and the foam is generated by objects intersecting the water surface. The distortion effect is achieved by applying the distortion texture on the UV coordinates.
